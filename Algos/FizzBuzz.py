"""
Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and 5 respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible
by 3, it is substituted with fizz; if a number is divisible by 5, it is substituted with buzz. If a number is simultaneously
a multiple of 3 AND 5, the number is replaced with "fizz buzz."
